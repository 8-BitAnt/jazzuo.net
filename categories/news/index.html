    <span class="bigtext">Returning for housekeeping!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span>Hello!! :D <br><br>
      I have been very absent on the development of this website for quite some time now, and because of recent activity in our <a href="/categories/discord/">Discord server</a> I have decided to return to do some housekeeping.<br><br>
      I've also updated my contact info on the <a href="/categories/contact/">Contact</a> page.<br><br>
      Very soon I will come back to update the <a href="/categories/all-archives/videos/">Video Archives</a> to completely finish that section of the site.<br>
      If there is anything else you would like to see updated, improved, changed or even any new additions to the site please let us know in our <a href="/categories/discord/">Discord server's</a> #help-and-questions channel!<br><br>
      Hope you are doing all well, thanks for reading and happy holidays!<br><br> -Ant :]

    <span class="bigtext">🎉 Happy 20th Sexy Hiking!!! 🎉</span><br>
    <br>
    <span>When Sexy Hiking was released on 9/17/2003, Jazzuo probably wouldn't have expected the attention it got years later.<br><Br>
      
      Its rise in popularity began when a game named "Getting Over It by Bennett Foddy" was released on Steam, but it was still quite popular even before that and Jazzuo fans back then loved it just the same! <br><br> 
      
      Sexy Hiking is a fun little game that I'm sure you all know of, and as of 9/17/2023 it turned 20 years old, which is nuts! <br><br>
      
      I want to ramble on more and more so read the contents of the page linked below, it will even have fan creations included and will be updated as people create more! 
      <br><br>

      So join our <a href="https://discord.gg/H4b3tsrt">Discord server</a> to submit your work if you'd like!

    <span class="bigtext">Undergoing changes...</span><br>
    <br>
    <span>Currently just cleaning up the site to make the front page contain less links, everything else can be found in
      the "More" section. I also added more types of archives under the "All Archives" link. This will contain old sites
      made by Jazzuo and videos he made.<br><br>

    <span class="bigtext">All games have been added!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span>We added the last category today, soon a download to have all of his games will become available at the top of
      the Games Page, just keep in mind this includes some of his crude/offensive games too.<br><br>

      If you have a download to any missing games please contact us and let either me or Anton know!<br><br>

    <span class="bigtext">Checking in...</span><br>
    <br>
    <span>Hey there! I figured I'd put out this post to update everyone on the sites current state, I have slowly been
      updating the site and adding more games and I hope to add all of them pretty soon! (Were almost there!) Once every
      game has it's own page and also to ensure we have every game on the list I will release a complete download of all
      of Jazzuo's games so it's easier for you to download all of them. The Czech version of the site has also been
      removed for now until it's completed. Hope you're all having a great day!<br><br>

      Also you should check out the <a href="https://gamebanana.com/games/17716">Sexy Hiking Modding Community</a> if
      you haven't already!<br><br>

    <span class="bigtext">Jazzuo.net has been rebranded!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span>Hello, guys! After forgetting to renew the domain for Jazzuo.fun, a bot bought it and now uses it to redirect
      to inappropriate material. We couldn't buy it back, so we decided to buy Jazzuo.net instead! Besides, many people
      are more familiar with the new extension. I'll be occasionally making more games available and continuing to work
      on the site in the coming days. I hope you're all having a nice day!<br><br>

    <span class="bigtext">Hello World!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span>The site has just been switched from <a href="/https://replit.com/">Replit</a> to <a
        href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and should be a lot more stable than it previously was. The site is still
      a huge WIP so expect a lot of it to still be pretty broken. Feel free to join our server for updates!<br><br>
